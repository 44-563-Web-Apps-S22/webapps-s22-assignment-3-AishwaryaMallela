    <h1>Aishwarya Mallela</h1>
    <h3>Magadheera</h3>
    <p>
        It is a story of 16th century about Kala bhairava (Ram charan teja) who is the protector of Udayghad kingdom and princess Mitra(Kajal Agarwal).<br>
        I liked the way the movie has been directed and also a beautiful art department which had enlightented the movie to the next level.
