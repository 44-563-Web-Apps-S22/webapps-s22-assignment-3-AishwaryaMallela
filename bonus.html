    <h1><i>Auburn Aubie</i></h1>
    <p>
        Aubie is an anthropomorphic tiger in orange and black in color. It is represented for football.<br>
        A popular character among Auburn fans and one of the most animated mascots in the country, Aubie is the living spirit of Auburn.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Aubie's existence began as a cartoon character that first appeared on the Auburn/Hardin-Simmons football program cover on October 3, 1959.</li>
        <li>Birmingham Post-Herald artist Phil Neel created the cartoon Tiger who continued to adorn Auburn program covers for 18 years.</li>
        <li>Aubie's appearances on game programs proved to be somewhat of a good luck charm for Coach Ralph "Shug" Jordan's teams.</li>
